# Laboratory 5 - executors, futures, parallel Mandelbrot

Implement parallel computation of Mandelbrot set, using worker threads with Executor and Futures.  
Measure times for varying parameters:  
  - number of threads (compared to number of processors)  
  - number of workers (compared to number of threads)
